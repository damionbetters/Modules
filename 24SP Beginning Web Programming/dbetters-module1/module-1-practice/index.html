    <h2>Fun Facts About Black Jaguars</h2>
    <p>
      Jaguars are amazing! My favorite panther, and what this page is acutally
      about, is the black jaguar. Blacks jaguars are one of, if not the, best
      hunters of the large cats. Black jaguars are smart, agile, and pretty
      fast. They are also pretty well known, Black Panther. Black panthers
      consists mainly of black jaguars and black leopards.
